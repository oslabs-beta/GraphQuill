Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

### A quick summary and/or background
Steps to reproduce
Be specific!
Give sample code if you can. Include sample code that anyone can run to reproduce what you are experiencing
What you expected would happen
What actually happens
Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

### Use a Consistent Coding Style (Airbnb)
We have our included our eslint setup in this repo to make this as painless as possible. Please also install the VS Code [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension.
